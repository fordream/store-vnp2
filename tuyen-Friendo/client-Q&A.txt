2. Hosting
The site would be hosted on Elastx: http://elastx.se/ which the client says is very good and scalable solution. We will get more info from the client when we approach that mile stone.

Would you have any comments to this? 

3. Crash reports, Android
The client asks if this is something we can get into the Android-version? http://www.acra.ch/

4. SMS
The client checked some SMS-providers:

Would you have any comments or alternatives that you'd like to suggest?
